# Slack Pomodoro App in Electron

![App icon in OSX tray displaying time](https://goo.gl/yOrILm "Pomodoro app screenshot")

This is a very simple pomodoro app in electron. It doesn't have any fancy features, just does what it's supposed to!

This is all it does:

* Start/stop the timer
* Rings a bell and displays a notification when your 20 minutes are over
* Displays the time in the menu bar when timer is started
* Support breaks (5min and 10min)
* Turns on the Do Not Disturb mode on Slack while timer runs
* Sets custom Slack status with emoji while running

Currently only available on OS X, PR's are welcome!
